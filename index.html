   <h2>What are they?</h2>
   <p>
       It is an aromatic substance found commonly in plants.
       Thousands of years ago, medical professionals used herbal medicine to treat any illness or sickness. It was later discovered that these essential oils contained compounds that affected mood and emotion through scent, and thus the practice of aromatherapy was formed and continued to this day. 
   </p>
   <p>Benefits of Essential Oils include:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Improvement of Mood</li>
       <li>Helps with Sleep</li>
       <li>Relieves Inflammation and Pain Relief</li>
       <li>Safer alternative to candles and incense</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>What they are NOT</h2>
   <p>
       They are <span>NOT</span> medicine.
       They will not cure or prevent diseases. Nor will they help with healing major injuries.
       We also have to be aware that not all natural oils are safe.
       Some oils may cause allergic reactions, skin irritation, breathing problems, and - in major cases - health problems such as miscarriage in pregnant women.
