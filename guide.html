        <li>When applying to the skin, make sure the essential oil(s) is diluted. Otherwise it might cause irritation.</li>
        <li>Purchase oils from a trustworthy company (do your research, look up reviews).</li>
        <li>These will not replace actual medicine/drugs. Discuss with doctor or professional, don't just take it because a friend/family member recommended it.</li>
        <li>Don't use essential oils near open flame, they are flammable.</li>
        <li>If you notice any side effects, discontinue use. You can use do a patch test by diluting the oil with a carrier oil, put the mixture on your arm, and leave it for a few hours. If you notice irritation, immediately clean the area with soap and water.</li>
